	<description>A deep drill that uses the bill system. It allows players to specify who can operate it. I can think of 2 reasons why one would want such a machine:
[list]
[*]Drills for highly value ores can be used only by highly skilled pawns. Beginners can operate drills for stone chunks.
[*]Not everyone should venture far from base to operate drills.
[/list]
The haul options for bill do not mean anything here. So "Do X times", "Do until you have X" will not work. Neither does "Haul to stockpile". Billed drill can give mining exp and trigger infestations, as expected. This shares the same infestation mechanism with the vanilla drill.

There should not be any conflict with other mod. Please let me know if any! I only use about 20 mods myself. 

Can be safely added mid-game.
